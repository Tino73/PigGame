A fun and easy game to play with your friends.
The game consists of two players, player1 and player2.
The active player can roll the dice for a chance to roll 1 to 6 points, he can continue so until he WINS with 100 points OR rolls 1 point.
If the active player rolls 1, his current points reset to 0, and it is the other players turn.
For the players that like to play it safe, after rolling the dice a few times, they can click "hold",
what "hold" will do is that the current points will be saved to permanent points, and it is the other players turn to play.

"New Game" button can be clicked at all times, to reset the game and start fresh.
